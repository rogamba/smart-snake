#Smart Snake
Supervised Hebbian learning for the snake game

## Training the net
Run the script with python snake.py and choose the option "Train", then play for a while. At the end of the training all your movements will be saved
in a file, which will be the training set matrix for the hebbian net. The output of every movement relative to the position of the apple will then be calculated.
